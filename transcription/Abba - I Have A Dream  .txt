I have a dream, a song to sing To help me cope with anything If you see the
wonder of a fairy tale You can take the future even if you fail I believe in
angels, something good in everything I see I believe in angels, when I know the
time is right for me I'll cross the stream, I have a dream I have a dream, a
fantasy To help me through reality And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness, still another mile I believe in angels, something
good in everything I see I believe in angels, when I know the time is right for
me I'll cross the stream, I have a dream I'll cross the stream, I have a dream I
have a dream, a song to sing To help me cope with anything To help me cope with
anything If you see the wonder of a fairy tale You can take the future even if
you fail I believe in angels, something good in everything I see I believe in
angels, when I know the time is right for me I'll cross the stream, I have a
dream I'll cross the stream, I have a dream I'll cross the stream, I have a
dream
