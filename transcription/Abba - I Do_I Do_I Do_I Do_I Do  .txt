Love me or leave me, make your choice, but believe me, I love you. I do, I do, I
do, I do, I do. I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it, don't you
do. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past,
now I just made it, I found you at last. So come on, now let's try it, I love
you, can't deny it, cause it's true. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. Oh no,
happiness between you and me. If we can't make it, we'll just wait and see. So
come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it, cause it's true. I do, I
do, I do, I do, I do. So love me or leave me, make your choice, but believe me,
I love you. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. I can't conceal it, don't you see,
can't you feel it, don't you do. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. I do, I do, I do,
I do, I do.
